# React + Vite

To create a screen for creating a strong password and its criteria in React, you can follow these steps:

- Create a PasswordInput Component: First, create a reusable PasswordInput component that allows users to input a password. You can use this component to capture the password from the user.

- Define Password Criteria: Define the criteria for a strong password. Typically, this includes minimum length, presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

- Display Password Strength Meter: Implement a password strength meter that visually shows the strength of the password based on the criteria. You can use a library like zxcvbn to calculate the strength of the password and display it to the user.

- Provide Feedback to User: Provide feedback to the user based on the strength of the password. For example, if the password is weak, display a message suggesting the user to include more characters or special characters.
